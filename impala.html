                    <h3>IMPALAS</h3>
                    <p>Impalas are sleek and agile antelopes found throughout African savannas and woodlands. With reddish-brown coats and white bellies,
they blend well into dry grasslands. Males have curved horns, while females do not. Impalas can leap more than 10 meters in a single bound, helping them escape
predators like leopards and cheetahs.</p>
                    <p>Living in large herds, impalas are constantly alert. They use snorts and whistles to warn each other of danger. Their diet mainly
includes grass and shrubs, making them important grazers in their environment.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Impalas are jumpy and fast! They live in big groups and can leap over bushes to run from danger. Look for their shiny brown coats and
twisty horns!</p>
