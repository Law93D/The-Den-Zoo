                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth, known for their incredible strength, intelligence, and complex social behavior. These 
gentle giants are easily recognized by their long trunks, large ears, and tusks, which they use for feeding, communication, and defense. Elephants live in tight-knit 
family groups led by a matriarch and form deep bonds with one another. They are known to grieve their dead, display empathy, and even use tools, making them one of 
the most emotionally advanced animals in the wild.</p>
                    <p>There are two main species of elephants: African and Asian. African elephants are larger with bigger ears shaped like the African continent, 
while Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears and a more curved spine. Both species rely heavily on water and vegetation, spending hours each day foraging and 
drinking. Unfortunately, elephants face threats from habitat loss and poaching for ivory. Conservation efforts worldwide are working to protect them and preserve 
their natural habitats for future generations.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Elephants can recognize themselves in mirrors and remember places for years? These amazing animals have huge brains and strong 
memories, which help them survive in the wild. An elephant's trunk is not just a nose — it’s a tool for eating, drinking, touching, and even greeting other elephants. 
They can make deep sounds to talk to each other from miles away. Elephants are not just big — they’re brilliant too!</p>
