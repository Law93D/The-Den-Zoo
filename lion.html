                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>Lions are iconic symbols of strength, courage, and leadership in the animal kingdom. Known as the “king of the jungle,” lions live in groups
called prides, which are usually led by a dominant male and made up of related females and their young. While males have majestic manes that set them apart, it's the
lionesses who do most of the hunting, working together to take down prey with skill and strategy.</p>
                    <p>Lions are powerful predators, but also highly social animals — unique among big cats. They communicate using roars, scent markings, and body
language. A lion’s roar can be heard up to 8 kilometers away, warning rivals and calling the pride together. Native to Africa’s savannas and grasslands, lions play
an important role in maintaining ecological balance by keeping herbivore populations in check.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Lions are strong, smart, and social! They live in family groups called prides and take care of each other. The females hunt for food, and the
males protect the pride with their loud roars and big manes. Lions are not just powerful — they’re team players of the wild!</p>
