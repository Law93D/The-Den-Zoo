                    <h3>JAGUARS</h3>
                    <p>Jaguars are the largest big cats in the Americas and are known for their powerful build and spotted golden coat. Native to rainforests, wetlands,
and scrublands, jaguars are solitary predators who prefer to stalk and ambush their prey. Unlike other big cats, they are strong swimmers and often hunt in or near water.</p>
                    <p>Their bite is one of the strongest among all cats, capable of piercing skulls or turtle shells. Jaguars are elusive and mostly active at night.
As top predators, they help control populations of prey animals and keep ecosystems in balance.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Jaguars are strong and sneaky! They move quietly through forests and love water. With big spots and big power, they’re the kings of the jungle in
South America!</p>
