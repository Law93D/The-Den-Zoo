                    <h3>RHINOCEROS</h3>
                    <p>Rhinos are large, thick-skinned herbivores known for their horns made of keratin (the same stuff as hair and nails). There are five species
worldwide, and two—black and white rhinos—live in Africa. Despite their size, rhinos can run fast and are mostly peaceful, spending their days grazing on grass or
browsing bushes.</p>
                    <p>Rhinos are endangered due to poaching and habitat loss. They play a key role in shaping landscapes and helping other species thrive.
Conservation efforts aim to protect their future.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Rhinos are big, strong, and peaceful! Their horns help them dig and defend, and they love rolling in mud to stay cool. Help protect them
from danger!</p>
