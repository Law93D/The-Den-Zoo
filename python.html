                    <h3>PYTHONS</h3>
                    <p>Pythons are large, non-venomous snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia. They are constrictors, which means they kill prey by coiling around
it and squeezing until it stops breathing. Pythons can grow to incredible lengths — some species reaching over 20 feet — and swallow prey whole thanks to their stretchy jaws.</p>
                    <p>They usually hunt at night, using heat-sensitive pits and strong muscles to detect and capture animals. Pythons play an important role in their
ecosystems by controlling rodent and small mammal populations. Though often feared, they are shy and prefer to avoid humans.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Pythons are strong, silent hunters! They don’t bite with poison — they squeeze their food and swallow it whole. These amazing snakes help keep
the balance in nature.</p>
