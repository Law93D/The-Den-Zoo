                    <h3>ZEBRAS</h3>
                    <p>Zebras are known for their striking black and white stripes, each with a unique pattern like a fingerprint. These social animals live in herds
and rely on group behavior for safety. Their stripes may help confuse predators, regulate body temperature, or even repel insects. Zebras mostly eat grass and spend
much of their time grazing on open plains.</p>
                    <p>There are three species of zebras — plains, mountain, and Grevy’s zebra — all native to Africa. They are constantly on the move in search of
food and water, often traveling with wildebeest and other herbivores. Zebras are vocal and alert animals, using brays and body movements to communicate danger and
maintain herd structure.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Zebras are wild and wonderful! Their black and white stripes help them hide in grasslands, and no two zebras have the same pattern. They live
in herds and always look out for each other!</p>
