                    <h3>BUFFALOS</h3>
                    <p>Buffalos are powerful and resilient animals that roam grasslands, savannas, and wetlands in large herds. Known for their sturdy bodies,
curved horns, and strong social bonds, buffalos rely on group behavior to protect themselves from predators. In the wild, they are often seen moving in coordinated
herds, and when threatened, they form a defensive circle around their young — a true display of teamwork and strength.</p>
                    <p>The African buffalo, also known as the Cape buffalo, is one of the “Big Five” game animals and is respected for its unpredictable nature.
Unlike domesticated water buffalos found in Asia, African buffalos have never been tamed. They play a vital role in the ecosystem by grazing and maintaining grassland
balance. Despite their calm appearance, they are known to fiercely defend themselves and their herd when challenged.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Buffalos are strong, smart, and stick together! They live in large herds and help protect each other from danger. Their big, curved horns are
used for defense, and their sharp hearing helps them stay alert. Buffalos may look calm, but they’re brave and bold — always ready to protect their family!</p>
