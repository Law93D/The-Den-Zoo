                    <h3>HYENAS</h3>
                    <p>Hyenas are intelligent, powerful scavengers and hunters known for their eerie laughter and strong jaws. Though often misunderstood as only
scavengers, many hyenas hunt for themselves and live in structured clans led by dominant females. The spotted hyena is the most well-known species, especially in
African savannas.</p>
                    <p>Hyenas are incredibly vocal animals that communicate using sounds, body language, and scent marking. They have excellent night vision and
are highly efficient eaters, leaving almost nothing behind. Their adaptability makes them one of Africa’s most successful carnivores.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Hyenas laugh, lead, and live in groups! They may look sneaky, but they’re smart hunters and great team players. Their strong teeth can even
crush bones!</p>
