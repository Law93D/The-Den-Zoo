                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, reaching heights of up to 18 feet thanks to their long necks and legs. They use their height
to reach leaves at the tops of trees, especially from their favorite food — acacia trees. Despite their height, giraffes only have seven neck bones — the same number
as humans!</p>
                    <p>Giraffes live in loose herds and are generally peaceful animals. Their long necks also help in “necking” battles — a way males compete for
mates by swinging their heads like hammers. Their unique spots help with camouflage and temperature regulation.</p>
                    <h4>DID YOU KNOW!</h4>
                    <p>Giraffes are tall and gentle giants! Their long necks help them reach tree leaves, and their spots make them stand out. They walk gracefully
and see far across the savanna!</p>
